# Flight Advisor Service [Facebook Follow](https://web.facebook.com/abdelhasib.naamaoui.9/)

Flight advisor Service is a set of APIs for primarily finding the cheapest flight from city A to 
city B based on price, and as a result it's returning all the trip information alongside the 
distance(s).

## System Functionality
- This project is developing a layered monolith **Spring Boot** based project (The latest version 2.
  7.0.M3), with an embedded database mode.
- This project is an OAuth2 based project, using JWT token to secure endpoints. So you need to register first to continue using the system.
- The functionality is reached based on user role, and there are three roles in the system.
    - **Admin**: user is a predefined user (*admin@traveladvisor.com/Admin1234*). 
        - Admin needs to log-in first through `/login` API to get their token to contact the system.
        - This user can upload airports and flight routes.
        - Admin manages cities by adding, updating, or deleting them.
        - Actually, the admin can do anything in the system.
    -  **Client**: Clients should register first before using the system through `/register` public API. 
        -  After successful registration, they can then use the public `/login` API to get a token to contact the system successfully.
        - Client can use all read API calls.
        - Clients can add, manage their comments for a city, add, update, delete their comments, and see other comments.
        - User can get the cheapest flight by calling `/cities/travel` API and provide airport codes for [from the city] and [to the city].
    -  **Public**: it is not a role, but anonymous users use APIs under public.
        - Use `/login` API call to log-in to the system, supplying the username and password. Then 
          you will 
          get a valid JWT token.
        - Use `/register` API call to register as a client to use the system functionalities 
          related to the client, otherwise for he will receive *Not Authorized*.

## Getting started
### Project Management
1. I have used GitHub projects to manage my tasks in the **Flight-Advisor** project. [Project Link](https://github.com/abdelhasib/Flight-Advisor-Abdelhasib).
2. All MVP tasks are assigned to the **Flight Advisor API MVP** Milestone. [Milestone Link](https://github.com/abdelhasib/Flight-Advisor-Abdelhasib).
3. I used pull requests to manage and close assigned tasks. [Tasks Link](https://github.com/abdelhasib/Flight-Advisor-Abdelhasib).
4. Finally, I have added releases to manage small features sprints until the final release v1.0. [Releases Link].

### System components Structure
Let's explain first the system layers structure to understand its components:
```
Flight-Advisor --> Parent folder. 
|- docs --> Contains system images.
|- data --> Contains Airports and routes files.
|- frontend --> Contains the frontend UI project.
|- src/main/java - org.siriusxi.htec.fa (package) 
  |- FlightAdvisorApplication.java --> The main starting point of the application.
  |- api --> Contains All REST API controllers that receive requests from the client,
             to process that request, and finally, return appropriate responses.
  |- repository --> All the database entities CRUD management services. 
  |- domain --> Domain contains all the database modeled entities, 
                all request and response DTOs, as well as the mappers.
  |- infra --> Contains all the configurations, exceptions, security management, 
               and support utilities to the system. 
  |- service --> Contains all the system business login, 
                 receives calls from Controllers, call repository to retrieve and manage data, 
                 then process them to return them to Controllers. 
```
Now, as we have learned about different system layers and components, so it is the time then to 
play, let's play.

### Access Flight Advisor System APIs
You can play and test `Flight Advisor` APIs throughout its **OpenAPI** interface. 
1. Go to the landing page at the following URL [http://localhost:8090/flight/service/api/](http://localhost:8090/flight/service/api/).
2. Follow the link on the page, and you should see the following:


3. More beautifully with its UI at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/), and you 
   expect this view for login:

![FA-Login ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24509699/160501520-fafb668e-d42a-4534-a65a-13431691183e.png)

   
   And this view after login, to travel:
   ![System-API](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24509699/160501713-7be5fc0b-e18a-4d84-853a-4c4702821cff.png)

#### System Behaviour
1. First, if you want to upload airports or routes (in the data folder) using the **Files upload Management** section: 
     1. You need to log-in with the provided admin username/password to the `public/login` endpoint.
     2. On a successful login, the response will contain an authorization token; copy it.
     3. Click on the Authorize button and paste it in the only field out there, `value,` then click the `Authorize` button.
     4. Now, all locks are closed, and you can use the secured APIs.
2. If you are a new client and want to access the system, you need first to register through the `/public/register` endpoint. Then follow previous point **1.1**.
3. When uploading the Airports file, countries and cities will be created automatically.
4. All search parameters are case-insensitive, and the system use like search by default.
5. To add a city, you need a country, so from the **country management** section, you can search for the country you want.
6. To manage comments, you need a city, so from the **city management** section, you can get all cities or search for a specific city.
7. You can search for all airports for a specific city to know their codes, so you can use travel service.
8. Use travel service to search for the cheapest flight from city to city, for example traveling from **CAI** (*Cairo International Airport, Egypt*) to **LAX** (*Los Angeles, USA*) the following results will be returned:

```JSON
[
  {
    "start": {
      "airport": "Cairo International Airport",
      "city": "Casablanca",
      "country": "maroc",
      "iata": "CAI"
    },
    "through": [
      {
        "airport": "Lester B. Pearson International Airport",
        "city": "Toronto",
        "country": "Canada",
        "iata": "YYZ"
      }
    ],
    "end": {
      "airport": "Los Angeles International Airport",
      "city": "Los Angeles",
      "country": "United States",
      "iata": "LAX"
    },
    "price": {
      "total": 62.17,
      "currency": "US"
    },
    "distance": {
      "total": 12722.2,
      "in": "KM"
    }
  }
]
```

### Access Flight Advisor System Database
You can access database through it online console from the following URL [http://localhost:8090/flight/service/api/db-console/](http://localhost:8090/flight/service/api/db-console/) with the following properties:
- Driver class: `org.h2.Driver`
- JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:./db/flightDB`
- user: `sa`
- password: `Admin1234`

Hit test, and it should show a green bar for successful settings. So hit the **Connect** button and explore all data.

### Stopping The System
Just press the `CTRL+C` keys on the terminal.

### Closing The Story
